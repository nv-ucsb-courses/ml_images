## Introduction to machine learning for biological images and structural biology

**Instructor: Niels Volkmann**

**Course Description**

This course offers an introduction to machine learning for students with a biological or bioengineering background. A strong background in computer science is not required but a solid understanding of basic linear algebra and calculus is expected. The course is particularly focused on applications in bioimaging and structural biology. We'll start with a history of artificial intelligence to set the stage, then move into the basics of neural networks, helping you understand the key components that power these systems. As the course progresses, we'll explore modern machine-learning techniques like convolutional neural networks, transformers, autoencoders, and deep Q-learning, paying special attention to how these can be applied to bioimaging and structural biology problems. The final part of the course is dedicated to student presentations, where you'll choose and discuss research papers, giving you a chance to dive deeper into specific topics that interest you. By the end of the course, you should be equipped with a solid foundation in machine learning concepts and their practical applications in bioimaging and structural biology.


### Learning Objectives

-	Understand the historical background and fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
-	Identify and explain the key components and architectures of neural networks, including how they process and learn from data.
-	Gain familiarity with advanced machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, autoencoders, and deep Q-learning.
-	Gain an understanding of how to apply machine learning methods to bioimaging and structural biology.
-	Develop and present a comprehensive overview of a selected paper, demonstrating the ability to synthesize and communicate complex ideas effectively.

### Presentation Format
15 minutes presentation (sharp), 5 minutes for questions. Papers can either be selected from the list provided [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/dmxzezrx4yztq98p5jf9f/APhHThb5mSrmXrMMKzYlTkg?rlkey=vtog00ryx9oc1329h77pz6ew8&dl=0) (first come first serve) or from the general literature upon approval by the instructor. 

### Reference Material
Generally, textbooks do not adequately cover the areas we are discussing due to the exponential development curve of the field. This rapid advancement means that even recently published books can quickly become outdated. Nevertheless, here are two excellent textbooks that cover most of the basic concepts in depth:
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th Edition (2020) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig
* Deep Learning (2016) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Free online version [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

For many of the topics we discussed that are not covered in these books, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) often serves as a useful initial resource, although the quality can vary.
